# Project Overview

I'd like to build an iOS application that works on an iPhone or iPad. There are a number of games to choose from, it should all work offline (without an internet connection)

# Games

## Rainbow Road

All passengers in the car can call out vehicles they see that match the colour the rainbow.

The device shows the colour of vehicle to see, then the player clicks when that colour is observed, then it shows the next colour. There is a skip option available, and it'll circle back to this after all other colour vechicles have been observed. 

## 20 Questions

The player is show the name of an object, item of food, or animal and the other passengers have to guess using questions. There is a counter for the player to count down from 20 to 0.

Examples:

- Elephant
- Penguin
- Butterfly
- Shark
- Kangaroo
- Owl
- Dolphin
- Tiger
- Hamster
- Octopus
- Giraffe
- Bee
- Turtle
- Eagle
- Frog
- Horse
- Spider

- Rabbit
- Snake
- Pizza
- Ice cream
- Banana

## Find me

Enter the number of players, and then display the score for each player. When starting the game, the person holding the device is shown an item which the passengers have to spot. The first person to observe gets a point.

- Sheep

- Postbox
- Boat
- Train
- Bridge
- Castle
- Windmill
- Horse
- Telephone box
